a Buffer is a way to store and manipulate binary data in Node.js.
Examples of binary data include images, audio and video files, and raw data from a network.

Streams are a fundamental concept in Node.js applications,
enabling efficient data handling by reading or writing input and output sequentially.
They are handy for file operations, network communications,
and other forms of end-to-end data exchange.
