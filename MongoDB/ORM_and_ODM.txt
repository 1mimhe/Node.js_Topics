Object Relational Mapping (ORM) is a technique used in
creating a bridge between object-oriented programs and databases.
The mapping describes the connections between objects and various tables.
ORMs translate data between tables and create the SQL code for a relational database
to insert, update, create, and delete data (CRUD).
For Example) TypeORM, Sequelize, Knex.js, ...

Object Document Mapping (ODM) is used to interact with document-based databases, such as MongoDB.
Usually, when we interact with a MongoDB database, we work directly with the documents in the database,
which are stored in a format called BSON (a binary version of JSON).
An ODM, like Mongoose, provides a way to interact with the documents in the database using JavaScript objects.
With Mongoose, a JavaScript developer can define a schema to represent a "Person" entity,
and Mongoose will automatically handle all the CRUD operations.
