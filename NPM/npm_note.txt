install a specific version of npm:
npm i -g npm@Version
-g => globally

make package.json:
npm init
and then, answer to some question.
if you don't want to answer:
mpm init --yes

install a package:
npm i NameOfPackage
npm i NameOfPackage@Version
after install package;
name and version of that package, will be added to 'dependencies' in package.json,
and store the package and its dependencies in 'node_modules' folder.

We don't need to push 'node_modules' folder in our repository.(ignore)
Because our dependencies and their version are included in 'package.json',
and just with 'npm i' command, the contents of the folder will be downloaded again.
