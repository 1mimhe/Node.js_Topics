Template Engines:
We generate dynamic documents and save the dynamically generated content in a file.
We can create code easily and reuse it across the pages.
*** pug, EJS, handlebars(hbs), ...

We usually use it for CMS (Content management system) softwares.

There is no need to implement these pages using front-end technologies.
We design those parts by simply using ready codes about the management panel
and converting it to one of the template engines.

SSR:
SSR, short for Server-Side Rendering,
is a technique in web development where the webpage's content is rendered on the server
instead of the client's browser.
