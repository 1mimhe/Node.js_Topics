Router:
A router object is an isolated instance of middleware and routes. You can think of it as a “mini-application,”
capable only of performing middleware and routing functions. Every Express application has a built-in app router.

A router behaves like middleware itself,
so you can use it as an argument to app.use() or as the argument to another router’s use() method.
