When a user logins in, the authorization server issues an access token,
which is an artifact that client applications can use to make secure calls to an API server.
When a client application needs to access protected resources on a server on behalf of a user,
the access token lets the client signal to the server
that it has received authorization by the user to perform certain tasks or access certain resources.

There are different ways that a client application can get a new access token for a user.
For example, once an access token expires,
the client application could prompt the user to log in again to get a new access token.
Alternatively, the authorization server could issue a refresh token to the client application
that lets it replace an expired access token with a new one.

As mentioned, for security purposes, access tokens may be valid for a short amount of time.
Once they expire, client applications can use a refresh token to "refresh" the access token.
That is, a refresh token is a credential artifact
that lets a client application get new access tokens without having to ask the user to log in again.
